# Rutgers-Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the Project

For this project, web pages were navigated in order to scrape high-resolution images of the hemispheres of Mars. The images and their titles were populated into a list of
dictionaries. A web app was created using HTML that displays the images and their titles alongside other mars information.
